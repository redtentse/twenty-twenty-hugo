description: About the group

---
Our purpose is to unite women, to share information and support around women's reproductive cycles, and to build community and power. 

<br>

In our society, we are taught to be consistent and steady. Now is the time for us to listen to our bodies and to honor the cyclical nature of womanhood. 

<br>

In our society, menstruation is still taboo, seen as something inconvenient, dirty, or shameful. Now is the time for us to come together and to know that our wombs are the source of all life and that our cycles are our connection to the Divine Feminine within each of us.

<br>

**We meet on the first day of the new moon.** We take some time to inhabit a shared female space, to reflect on our cyclical journey and to gather strength from each other. **All women are welcome.** This is a community for everyone.
