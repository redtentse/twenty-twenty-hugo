<p>We are coming together in a new way and <b>you</b> are invited. On this page I'm providing some information in a question and answer format. If you would like more information, please use the contact form. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> What is this all about? </p> </blockquote>

<p> The Red Tent Movement is an [international movement](http://redtenttemplemovement.com/) of women to come together. The goal is to create a supportive community, also known as a women's circle. Together we can leave behind the shame and silence associated with menstruation and women's monthly cycles. Red Tent // Stockholm is an initiative to create a new space where this is possible. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> That sounds nice, but what are we going to do exactly? </p> </blockquote>

<p> We will meet throughout the year on the evening of the new moon. The next new moon is on July 20th, and this will be our first gathering. At our meeting we will (1) commune over food and drinks (2) do a gentle group meditation and (3) form a sharing circle where each participant has the space to express whatever she chooses in relation to her current experiences of womanhood, where she can be of judgement and where she can be heard and validated. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Is this some kind of a spiritual/religious thing? I'm just a normal person. </p> </blockquote>

<p> The aim is to give us as women space to explore our relationship to our own femininity. To do that we step back from our everyday lives which aren't oriented towards women's experiences of cyclical living. That in itself is a spiritual experience and it takes whatever form it needs to take for each individual. If you like thinking about the Divine Feminine or want to connect this experience to your spiritual practice, that is beautiful too. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Can you tell me about the practicalities? </p> </blockquote>

<p> We will meet in the evening on July 20th. The meeting will last about 2 hours. Sign up on the contact page and you'll receive information about the location. If you want to wear red, that can be poetic. You can bring a snack to share with others, but you don't have to. Participants are encouraged to donate 200 sek (100 sek for youths up to 26). </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Why do we meet at the new moon? </p> </blockquote>

<p> It's poetic. Some women's cycles are closely aligned with moon cycles, and some women's cycles aren't. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Jag vill inte prata engelska... </p> </blockquote>

<p> Det förstår jag. Jag försöker vara så öppen som möjligt eftersom jag är själv invandrare. Det är såklart du kan prata svenska i cirkeln om det är det som känns bra. </p>
