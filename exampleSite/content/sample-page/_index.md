<p>We are coming together in a new way and <b>you</b> are invited. On this page I'm providing some information in a question and answer format. If you would like more information, please use the contact form. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> What is this all about? </p> </blockquote>

<p> This women's circle is based on the Red Tent Movement, which is an [international movement](http://redtenttemplemovement.com/) of women coming together. The goal is to create a supportive community. Together we can leave behind the shame and silence associated with the spiritual, psychological, social, and physical experiences of womanhood. This community comes from a desire to create a space where sharing and safety is possible. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> That sounds nice, but what are we going to do exactly? </p> </blockquote>

<p> We plan to meet throughout the year on the dates of the new moon. The main focus of our meeting is to form a sharing circle where each participant has the space to express whatever she chooses in relation to her current experiences of womanhood, where she can be of judgement and where she can be heard and validated. We also do shared meditations, journaling, and other nourishing activities. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Is this some kind of a spiritual/religious thing? I'm just a normal person. </p> </blockquote>

<p> The aim is to give us as sense of community, and to give us as women the space to explore our relationship to our own femininity. To do that we step back from our everyday lives which aren't oriented towards women's experiences of cyclical living. That in itself is a spiritual experience and it takes whatever form it needs to take for each individual. If you like thinking about the Divine Feminine or want to connect this experience to your spiritual practice, that is beautiful too. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Can you tell me about the practicalities? </p> </blockquote>

<p> Sign up on the contact page and you'll receive information about the location and the time. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Why do we meet at the new moon? </p> </blockquote>

<p> It's poetic. Some women's cycles are closely aligned with moon cycles, and some women's cycles aren't. </p>
