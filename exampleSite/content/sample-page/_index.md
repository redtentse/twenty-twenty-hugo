<p>We are coming together in a new way and <b>you</b> are invited. On this page I'm providing some information in a question and answer format. If you would like more information, please use the contact form. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> What is this all about? </p> </blockquote>

<p> The Red Tent Movement is an [international movement](http://redtenttemplemovement.com/) of women to come together. The goal is to create a supportive community, also known as a women's circle. Together we can leave behind the shame and silence associated with women's monthly cycles and womanhood more generally. Red Tent // Stockholm is my desire to create another space where this sharing and community is possible. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> That sounds nice, but what are we going to do exactly? </p> </blockquote>

<p> We will meet throughout the year on the evening of the new moon. The next new moon is on July 20th, and this will be our first gathering. At our meeting we will (1) share some food (2) do a gentle group meditation and maybe even some crystal healing and (3) form a sharing circle where each participant has the space to express whatever she chooses in relation to her current experiences of womanhood, where she can be of judgement and where she can be heard and validated. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Is this some kind of a spiritual/religious thing? I'm just a normal person. </p> </blockquote>

<p> The aim is to give us as sense of community, and to give us as women the space to explore our relationship to our own femininity. To do that we step back from our everyday lives which aren't oriented towards women's experiences of cyclical living. That in itself is a spiritual experience and it takes whatever form it needs to take for each individual. If you like thinking about the Divine Feminine or want to connect this experience to your spiritual practice, that is beautiful too. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Can you tell me about the practicalities? </p> </blockquote>

<p> We will meet in the evening on July 20th. Sign up on the contact page and you'll receive information about the location and the time. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> What about the covid situation? </p> </blockquote>

<p> We will meet outside to take advantage of the summer weather and to be safe. Future events will be held indoors as the public health situation permits. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Why do we meet at the new moon? </p> </blockquote>

<p> It's poetic. Some women's cycles are closely aligned with moon cycles, and some women's cycles aren't. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p> Jag vill inte prata engelska... </p> </blockquote>

<p> Det förstår jag. Jag skriver på engelska eftersom jag är själv invandrare. Alla som kommer kan svenska och det är såklart du talar svenska i cirkeln om det är det som känns bra för dig. </p>
