## About Me

My name is Rita and I would like to create a community of women.

<br> I am 29 years old and over the last few years, I've been trying to bring my life more in line with my own hormonal cycle. It has been an interesting journey. I've realized how much easier it is to live in accordance to my body's rhythms. I've also realized that our world makes this difficult: it's kind of built for people who live in a steady state, expecting all weeks to be roughly similar. <br>

I think it would be beautiful to find more women to share the journey with me. For me, this isn't just about the hormonal cycle but about the shared experience of womanhood and how we experience being women in 2020. I really hope that you join me.

<br>
